Analyzing single-cell transcriptomes from 72,000+ cells in IUA and normal endometrial tissues revealed changes in cell types and molecular signatures associated with IUA. We found activated TREM2+ macrophages and vulnerable ANXA1+ NK cell subtypes. Additionally, MMP7+ and CCL5+ unciliated epithelial subtypes originated from PTTG1+ unciliated epithelium were susceptible to injury in IUA. This study provides insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of severe IUA, aiding future diagnostics and treatment strategies.

Highlights
Profiling a first single-cell transcriptomic atlas for IUA.
IUA-associated heterogenous DEGs in different cell types were identified.
TREM2+ macrophages with properties of inflammation regulation were activated in IUA.
MMP7+ and CCL5+ unciliated epithelial subtypes originated from PTTG1+ unciliated epithelium was susceptible to injury.
